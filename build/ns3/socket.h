/**
 * \brief A low-level Socket API based loosely on the BSD Socket API.
 * \ingroup socket
 *
 * A few things to keep in mind about this type of socket:
 * - it uses ns-3 API constructs such as class ns3::Address instead of
 *   C-style structs
 * - in contrast to the original BSD socket API, this API is asynchronous:
 *   it does not contain blocking calls.  Sending and receiving operations
 *   must make use of the callbacks provided. 
 * - It also uses class ns3::Packet as a fancy byte buffer, allowing 
 *   data to be passed across the API using an ns-3 Packet instead of 
 *   a raw data pointer.
 * - Not all of the full POSIX sockets API is supported
 *
 * Other than that, it tries to stick to the BSD API to make it 
 * easier for those who know the BSD API to use this API.
 * More details are provided in the ns-3 tutorial.
