 * \brief Artificial delay of UE measurements procedure.
 *
 * i.e. the period between the time layer-1-filtered measurements from PHY
 * layer is received and the earliest time the actual measurement report
 * submission to the serving cell is invoked.
 *
 * This delay exists because of racing condition between several UE measurements
 * functions which happen to be scheduled at the same time. The delay ensures
 * that:
 *  - measurements (e.g., layer-3 filtering) are always performed before
 *    reporting, thus the latter always use the latest measured RSRP and RSRQ;
 *    and
 *  - time-to-trigger check is always performed before the reporting, so there
 *    would still be chance for it to cancel the reporting if necessary.
