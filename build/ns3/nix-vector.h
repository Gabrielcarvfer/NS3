/**
 * \ingroup packet
 *
 * \brief Neighbor-index data structure for nix-vector routing
 *
 * This data structure holds a vector of "neighbor-indexes" for 
 * a simulation specific routing protocol, nix-vector routing.
 * Theses neighbor-indexes correspond to the net-device which a 
 * node should use to route a packet.  A nix-vector is built
 * (or fetched from a cache) on-demand. The nix-vector is 
 * transmitted with the packet, and along each hop of the 
 * route, the current node extracts the appropriate 
 * neighbor-index and routes the packet.
 *
 * \internal
 * The implementation of NixVector uses a vector to store 
 * the neighbor-indexes.  Each entry in the vector is 32 
 * bits long and can store multiple neighbor-indexes.  A 
 * fair amount of bit manipulation is used to store these 
 * neighbor-indexes efficiently.  A vector is used so that 
 * the nix-vector can grow arbitrarily if the topology and 
 * route requires a large number of neighbor-indexes.
 *
 * As the nix-vector travels along the route, an internal 
 * private member variable keeps track of how many bits 
 * have been used.  At a particular node, the nix-vector 
 * is used to return the next neighbor-index. This 
 * neighbor-index is used to determine which net-device 
 * to use.  The number of bits used would then be 
 * incremented accordingly, and the packet would be 
 * routed.
