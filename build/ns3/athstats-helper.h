/**
 * @brief trace sink for wifi device that mimics madwifi's athstats tool.
 *
 * The AthstatsWifiTraceSink class is a trace sink to be connected to several of the traces
 * available within a wifi device. The purpose of AthstatsWifiTraceSink is to
 * mimic the behavior of the athstats tool distributed wih the madwifi
 * driver. In particular, the reproduced behavior is that obtained
 * when executing athstats without parameters: a report written in
 * text format is produced every fixed interval, based on the events
 * observed by the wifi device.
 *
 * Differences with the "real" athstats:
 *
 * - AthstatsWifiTraceSink is expected to write its output to a file
 *   (not to stdout).
 *
 * - only a subset of the metrics supported by athstats is supported
 *   by AthstatsWifiTraceSink
 *
 * - AthstatsWifiTraceSink does never produce a cumulative report.
