 * The protocol type in GRE is supposed to be an Ethernet type value;
 * this file lists protocol type values for which nobody's found an
 * official Ethernet type definition and put that in "etypes.h".
 * Move these to "etypes.h" if you find an official Ethernet type
 * definition for them; when this file is empty, get rid of all includes
 * of it, and get rid of it.
