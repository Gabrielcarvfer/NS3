.SH NAME
ofp\-kill \- kills processes given their pidfiles

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ofp\-kill
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIpidfile\fR [\fIpidfile\fR...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBofp\-kill\fR program reads each \fIpidfile\fR specified on the
command line and sends a signal to the program associated with it, if
any.  It reads one line of text from \fIpidfile\fR, which must contain
the PID of the process to kill as a text string.  It then uses
\fBfcntl\fR(2) to verify that a process with the PID from the file
owns a lock on \fIpidfile\fR before it sends the signal.

A \fIpidfile\fR whose name begins with \fB/\fR is used literally.
Otherwise, \fB@RUNDIR@/\fR is prefixed.

This program exists for use by \fBofp\-switch\-setup\fR, which cannot
easily implement its functionality since Perl has no portable
interface to \fBfcntl\fR-based file locking.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-s \fInumber\fR|\fIname\fR, \fB\-\^\-signal=\fInumber\fR|\fIname\fR
Sets the signal to be sent to each process.  Signals may be given by
number (e.g. \fB1\fR) or by name (e.g. \fBHUP\fR or \fBSIGHUP\fR).
By default, \fBSIGTERM\fR is sent.

.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB\-\^\-force\fR
Causes \fBofp\-kill\fR to ignore all errors without printing a message
to \fBstderr\fR, and to exit with return code 0.

.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\^\-help
Prints a brief help message to the console.

.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\^\-version
Prints version information to the console.

.SH "EXIT CODE"

Without \fB-f\fR or \fB\-\^\-force\fR, \fBofp\-kill\fR exits with
status 0 if at least one \fIpidfile\fR was given and the process
represented by every \fIpidfile\fR was signaled successfully,
otherwise with status 1.

With \fB-f\fR or \fB\-\^\-force\fR, \fBofp\-kill\fR always exits with
status 0.

.SH BUGS

There is a race between verifying the lock on \fIpidfile\fR and
actually killing the process.

\fBofp\-kill\fR does not wait for the signaled processes to die before
exiting.
