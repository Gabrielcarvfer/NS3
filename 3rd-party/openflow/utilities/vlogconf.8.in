.SH NAME
vlogconf \- configuration utility for OpenFlow logging in userspace

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvlogconf\fR [\fB-h\fR | \fB--help\fR] [\fItarget\fR...] [\fIaction\fR...]

The available \fItarget\fR options are:
.br
[\fB-a\fR | \fB--all\fR] [\fB-t\fR \fIpid\fR | \fB--target=\fIpid\fR]
.sp 1
The available \fIaction\fR options are:
.br
[\fB-l\fR | \fB--list\fR] [\fB-s\fR
\fImodule\fR[\fB:\fIfacility\fR[\fB:\fIlevel\fR]] |
\fB--set=\fImodule\fR[\fB:\fIfacility\fR[\fB:\fIlevel\fR]]]
[\fB-r\fR | \fB--reopen\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBvlogconf\fR program configures the logging system used by 
OpenFlow userspace programs.  The logging configuration may be modified 
while OpenFlow programs are running.

\fBvlogconf\fR applies one or more actions to each of one or more
target processes.  Targets may be specified as:

.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB--all\fR
All running processes that \fBvlogconf\fR can control.

.TP
\fB-t \fItarget\fR, \fB--target=\fItarget\fR
The specified \fItarget\fR, which must take one of the following forms:

.RS
.IP \(bu
A PID (process ID).

.IP \(bu
An absolute path (beginning with `/') to the Unix domain socket for a
\fBvlogconf\fR-controllable process.

.IP \(bu
An absolute path (beginning with `/') to a pidfile (created by, e.g.,
passing the \fB-P\fR or \fB--pidfile\fR option to one of the OpenFlow
programs).  

.IP \(bu
None of the above, in which case \fItarget\fR prefixed by
\fB@RUNDIR@/\fR must match one of the cases for absolute paths listed
above.  (The default name for a program's pidfile is
\fB@RUNDIR@/\fIprogram\fB.pid\fR, so this means that, say,
\fBsecchan\fR's default pidfile may be referred to simply as
\fBsecchan.pid\fR.)
.RE

.PP
The available actions are:

.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--list\fR
Print the list of known modules and their current logging levels to
stdout.

.TP
\fB-s\fR \fImodule\fR[\fB:\fIfacility\fR[\fB:\fIlevel\fR]], \fB--set=\fImodule\fR[\fB:\fIfacility\fR[\fB:\fIlevel\fR]]

Sets the logging level for \fImodule\fR in \fIfacility\fR to
\fIlevel\fR.  The \fImodule\fR may be any valid module name (as
displayed by the \fB--list\fR option) or the special name \fBANY\fR to
set the logging levels for all modules.  The \fIfacility\fR may be
\fBsyslog\fR or \fBconsole\fR to set the levels for logging to the
system log or to the console, respectively, or \fBANY\fR to set the
logging levels for both facilities.  If it is omitted,
\fIfacility\fR defaults to \fBANY\fR.  The \fIlevel\fR must be one of
\fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, or \fBdbg\fR, designating the
minimum severity of a message for it to be logged.  If it is omitted,
\fIlevel\fR defaults to \fBdbg\fR.

.TP
\fB-s PATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR, \fB--set=PATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR

Sets the log pattern for \fIfacility\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Each time a
message is logged to \fIfacility\fR, \fIpattern\fR determines the
message's formatting.  Most characters in \fIpattern\fR are copied
literally to the log, but special escapes beginning with \fB%\fR are
expanded as follows:

.RS
.TP
\fB%A\fR
The name of the application logging the message, e.g. \fBsecchan\fR.

.TP
\fB%c\fR
The name of the module (as shown by \fBvlogconf --list\fR) logging
the message.

.TP
\fB%d\fR
The current date and time in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

.TP
\fB%d{\fIformat\fB}\fR
The current date and time in the specified \fIformat\fR, which takes
the same format as the \fItemplate\fR argument to \fBstrftime\fR(3).

.TP
\fB%m\fR
The message being logged.

.TP
\fB%N\fR
A serial number for this message within this run of the program, as a
decimal number.  The first message a program logs has serial number 1,
the second one has serial number 2, and so on.

.TP
\fB%n\fR
A new-line.

.TP
\fB%p\fR
The level at which the message is logged, e.g. \fBDBG\fR.

.TP
\fB%P\fR
The program's process ID (pid), as a decimal number.

.TP
\fB%r\fR
The number of milliseconds elapsed from the start of the application
to the time the message was logged.

.TP
\fB%%\fR
A literal \fB%\fR.
.RE

.IP
A few options may appear between the \fB%\fR and the format specifier
character, in this order:

.RS
.TP
\fB-\fR
Left justify the escape's expansion within its field width.  Right
justification is the default.

.TP
\fB0\fR
Pad the field to the field width with \fB0\fRs.  Padding with spaces
is the default.

.TP
\fIwidth\fR
A number specifies the minimum field width.  If the escape expands to
fewer characters than \fIwidth\fR then it is padded to fill the field
width.  (A field wider than \fIwidth\fR is not truncated to fit.)
.RE

.IP
The default pattern for console output is \fB%d{%b %d
%H:%M:%S}|%05N|%c|%p|%m\fR; for syslog output, \fB%05N|%c|%p|%m\fR.

.TP
\fB-r\fR, \fB--reopen\fR
Causes the target application to close and reopen its log file.  (This
is useful after rotating log files, to cause a new log file to be
used.)

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\^\-help\fR
Prints a brief help message to the console and exits.
