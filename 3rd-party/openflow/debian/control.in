Suggests: openflow-switch
Description: Source code for OpenFlow datapath Linux module
 This package provides the OpenFlow datapath module source code that
 is needed by the kernel-based OpenFlow switch.  The kernel module can
 be built from it using module-assistant or make-kpkg.  README.Debian
 in this package provides further instructions.

Package: openflow-pki-server
Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${perl:Depends}, openflow-pki, apache2
Description: OpenFlow public key infrastructure (HTTP server support)
 openflow-pki-server provides HTTP access to the OpenFlow PKI (public
 key infrastructure) maintained on the local machine by the
 openflow-pki package.  This HTTP access is needed for secure and
 convenient OpenFlow switch setup using the ofp-switch-setup program
 in the openflow-switch package.
