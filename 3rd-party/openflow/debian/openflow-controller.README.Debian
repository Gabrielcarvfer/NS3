README.Debian for openflow-controller
-------------------------------------

* To (re)configure the controller, edit /etc/default/openflow-controller
  and run "/etc/init.d/openflow-controller restart".

* To enable OpenFlow switches to automatically discover the location
  of the controller, you must install and configure a DHCP server.
  The secchan(8) manpage (found in the openflow-switch package) gives
  a working example configuration file for the ISC DHCP server.
