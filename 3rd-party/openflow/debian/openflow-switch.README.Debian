README.Debian for openflow-switch
---------------------------------

* The switch must be configured before it can be used.  To configure
  it interactively, install the openflow-switch-config package and run
  the ofp-switch-setup program.  Alternatively, edit
  /etc/default/openflow-switch by hand, then start the switch manually
  with "/etc/init.d/openflow-switch start".

* To use the Linux kernel-based switch implementation, you will need
  to build and install the OpenFlow kernel module.  To do so, install
  the openflow-datapath-source package, then follow the instructions
  given in /usr/share/doc/openflow-datapath-source/README.Debian

* This package does not yet support the userspace switch
  implementation.
