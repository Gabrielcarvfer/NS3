Thank you for downloading BRITE.  Up to date information can be found
at the BRITE website at http://www.cs.bu.edu/brite/.

The contents of this README are:
  1.  Quick Start
  2.  Where everything is
  3.  More Documentation
  4.  Bugs, mailing lists and other contact information


1. Quick Start:
----------------

To get BRITE up and running, change your working directory to the
location where you downloaded the tar.gz BRITE file.  Once there,
execute the following at the command prompt:
	
  $ gunzip BRITE.tar.gz
  $ tar xvf BRITE.tar.gz
  $ cd BRITE/   	
  $ make all	(Alternatively, to make the C++ version, type "make c++"
		 and to make the Java version, "make java")

To run BRITE with the GUI type:
  $ ./startGUI     

To run the command line C++ version, type:
  $ cd C++/  
  $ brite <conf-file> <out-file> <seed-file>    

To run the command line of the Java version, type:
  $ cd Java/  
  $ java Main.Brite <conf-file> <out-file> <optional-seed-file>


2.  Where everything is:
-------------------------

Depending on which distribution you chose to download, some files from
the listing below might be missing in your distribution.  This README
is common across all distributions and lists the files included in the
complete distribution (Java & C++):


 + ~/BRITE/
    - GUI/		#The GUI source files
    - C++/		#The C++ source files (also brite executable)	
    - Java/		#The Java source (and class) files
    - Makefile		#The main Makefile		
    - startGUI		#A helper shell script to launch the GUI



3.  More Documentation:
------------------------

Source level HTML documentation specific to the Java version of BRITE
is available.  To make the documentation, change your working
directory to the Java version and type:
  $ make javadoc 
This will create the source level API documentation in a folder called
javadoc/ in the current directory.
 
We highly recommend that you read the BRITE user manual to get the
most out of BRITE.  This manual describes the BRITE architecture and
also includes sections on installing, using and extending BRITE with
examples.  The current version of the user manual can always be
downloaded (in Postscript or PDF format) from
http://www.cs.bu.edu/brite/docs.html.

You may also ask any questions about running BRITE at the BRITE-Users
mailing list. (see below)


4.  Contact Us:
----------------

If you find bugs in BRITE, please email a detailed report describing
the bug to brite-developers@cs.bu.edu.  Also, if you have extended

same email address.  We maintain a repository of contributed
generation models and would like to incorporate your generation model
