The goal of the [5G-RANGE](http://5g-range.eu/) project is to design, develop, 
implement and validate the mechanisms to enable the 5G network to provide an 
economically effective solution for Internet access for remote areas.

In terms of simulations, our goal was to implement the channel model of the 5G-RANGE project, 
validate the results based on the field trials measurements, provide dynamic spectrum access capabilities
that enable opportunistic use of the spectrum underutilized by TV white spaces.

## How do you get it?
Following instructions in [COLAB-5G](https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/COLAB_5G/).

An example of a setup using it is available [here](https://github.com/Gabrielcarvfer/NS3/blob/NS3.30.1-colab5g/scratch/5grange_cdl_test.cc).

## What have we done so far in terms of system-level simulations?

We used the [LTE/LENA](http://networks.cttc.es/mobile-networks/software-tools/lena/) model 
of the [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) simulator as the basis for our project. 
The original code follows the 3GPP LTE specifications really closely, 
providing a solid foundation for mobile networks development.

## How about some results and nice pictures?
Sure. Here are some of them.

### Field trial measurements

The field trial was executed by the Inatel and the Federal University of Cear√° (UFC) teams, and findings were published in 
[5G-RANGE Project Field Trial](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802021)

The following images are from the field trial paper mentioned above.

### Channel validation

There were two channel models proposed based on CDL D and A, for LOS and NLOS scenarios, respectively.

The models were proposed by the UFC team and published 
in [CDL-based Channel Model for 5G MIMO Systems in Remote Rural Areas](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8877334).

Our implementation (5G-RANGE in the figures below) matches the expected results for both CDL D and CDL A.

### PHY and MAC validation

The PHY and MAC were validated comparing to the proof-of-concept measurements made in the field trials.

The simulated performance matched the real-life results from the trials.

The results for TBLER on the other hand, were a lot higher on the field trial measurements for NLOS at 40km.

### Dynamic Spectrum Access with Collaborative Spectrum Sensing

This is my main contribution, and it was done in collaboration from our friends from the University of Oulu.

How can we detect a primary user (channel licensee)? There are many ways, but the one that doesn't have to rely on
a central entity giving out temporary licenses is basically some form of spectrum sensing.

Since a single point sensing the spectrum in a 50km-wide cell isn't very effective since the sensing
element can be far enough of the licensee to perceive it is transmitting. If both transmit simultaneously,
we cause interference, which is not desirable nor allowed. 

Using collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a lot more logical in this case.
CSS allow multiple sensing elements to perform their sensing independently
and merge/fuse their sensing results later.

![](/NS3/img/5g-range/spectrum-sensing.png)

In our case, the individual sensing technique used is based on the technique proposed on 
[Spectrum window based signal detection at low SNR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8398726),
known as WIBA.

The sensing results are then fused according to a fusion scheme/policy on the LTE's eNodeB
(which is very logical, since we are using a centralized network as the base for 5G-RANGE).

We have shown in [MHM: A Novel Collaborative Spectrum Sensing Method based on Markov-chains and Harmonic Mean for 5G Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9142763),
a particular combination of techniques to have an effective fusion scheme.

We used the BLER as a source of trust of the reported CQI by the UEs.

The trusted CQI can then be correlated with the sensing data: when a primary user starts transmitting, 
it is expected that nearby UEs have a drop in CQI. We can filter the others out by filtering by the
harmonic mean of reported CQIs.

Building that trust makes us less exposed to Byzantine attackers (either malicious sensing reports or faulty ones).

We also employed a Markov Chain to make the individual sensing reports (sent on channel condition change) 
more stable temporally, saving up some control channel bandwidth at the cost of detection range.

The images below show how false positives (a.k.a. unused spectrum), 
false negatives (a.k.a. interference with the primary user PU)
and reported frames per UE (a.k.a. control channel overhead) 
scale with the number of UEs during different simulations.

#### With 20 UEs

#### With 50 UEs

#### With 100 UEs
![](/NS3/img/5g-range/sensing_per_scenario_ues_100_simulationCase_11.png)

Of course, we simulated all of these in both scenarios with randomly dispersed UEs (less realistic)
and scenarios with randomly dispersed clusters of UEs (e.g. rural businesses, small city, rural school, etc).

## Acknowledgments
I want to thank every ns-3 developer, especially the CTTC people for the LTE/LENA model. 
It was essential for our project.

I'm also very grateful to all of our partners that enabled us to deliver an amazing simulation tool, 
that produces realistic results for our scenarios. 

I'm very optimistic that our work will end up in the wild, providing network connectivity for remote areas in Brazil,
Europe and others.
