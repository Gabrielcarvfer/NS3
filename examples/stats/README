			  ns-3 stats example

The example script wifi-example-db.sh in this directly will run
through the entire process of running a simple experiment.  It assumes
sqlite3 is installed as it uses the sqlite3 data output format of the
statistics package.  It also assumes it is being run from the
examples/stats/ subdirectory of the ns-3 package, together with its
gnuplot script.  When the script completes successfully, a graph will
be have been produced in examples/stats/wifi-default.eps demonstrating
output from this example.

More information on the statistics package and this example is
available online on the ns-3 wiki at:

*** Using ns-3 with the OMNeT++ analysis tool ***

The stat framework can write out the result in a format that is compatible with the
output format of OMNeT++ 4 Discrete Event Simulator Framework.
Use the wifi-example-omnet.sh script to generate the results in OMNeT++ format.

If you want to analyse the results with OMNeT++'s result analyser tool:
a) Download OMNeT++ 4 and install it. Start the IDE. (www.omnetpp.org)
b) If you do not want to install the whole simulator framework, there is a seperate 
   package which contains only the analysis tool from the OMNeT++ package.
   You can download it from http://omnetpp.org/download/release/omnetpp-scave.tgz

Once you are running the OMNeT++ IDE or the separate analysis tool (SCAVE)
- Choose File|Import...|Existing Projects into Workspace, then click [Next]
- Select root directory. (choose the examples/stats directory) and click [Finish]

Double click the wifi-example-omnet.anf in the opened project and select 
the Chart page to see the created chart. Experiment with the analysis tool and read its
documentation: http://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp40/userguide/ch09.html
