/**
 * \ingroup wifi
 * \brief Block Ack window
 *
 * This class provides the basic functionalities of a window sliding over a
 * bitmap: accessing any element in the bitmap and moving the window forward
 * a given number of positions. This class can be used to implement both
 * an originator's window and a recipient's window.
 *
 * The window is implemented as a vector of bool and managed as a circular
 * queue. The window is moved forward by advancing the head of the queue and
 * clearing the elements that become part of the tail of the queue. Hence,
 * no element is required to be shifted when the window moves forward.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * |0|1|1|0|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|0|
 *                      ^
 *                      |
 *                     HEAD
 *
 * After moving the window forward three positions:
 *
 * |0|1|1|0|1|1|1|0|1|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|
 *                            ^
 *                            |
 *                           HEAD
