  /**
  * Represents the state for this agreement.
  *
  *  PENDING:
  *    If an agreement is in PENDING state it means that an ADDBARequest frame was sent to
  *    recipient in order to setup the block ack and the originator is waiting for the relative
  *    ADDBAResponse frame.
  *
  *  ESTABLISHED:
  *    The block ack is active and all packets relative to this agreement are transmitted
  *    with ack policy set to block ack.
  *
  *  INACTIVE:
  *    In our implementation, block ack tear-down happens only if an inactivity timeout occurs
  *    so we could have an active block ack but a number of packets that doesn't reach the value of
  *    m_blockAckThreshold (see ns3::BlockAckManager). In these conditions the agreement becomes
  *    INACTIVE until that the number of packets reaches the value of m_blockAckThreshold again.
  *
  *  UNSUCCESSFUL (not used for now):
  *    The agreement's state becomes UNSUCCESSFUL if:
  *
  *    - its previous state was PENDING and an ADDBAResponse frame wasn't received from
  *      recipient station within an interval of time defined by m_bAckSetupTimeout attribute
  *      in ns3::WifiMac.
  *    - an ADDBAResponse frame is received from recipient and the Status Code field is set
  *      to failure.
  *
  *    In both cases for station addressed by BlockAckAgreement::m_peer and for
  *    TID BlockAckAgreement::m_tid block ack mechanism won't be used.
