/**
 * \brief Constant OBSS PD algorithm
 * \ingroup wifi
 *
 * This constant OBSS_PD algorithm is a simple OBSS_PD algorithm which evalutes if a receiving
 * signal should be accepted or rejected based on a constant threshold.
 *
 * Once a HE preamble and its header have been received by the PHY, the ReceiveHeSig method is
 * triggered. The algorithm then checks whether this is an OBSS frame by comparing its own BSS
 * color with the BSS color of the received preamble. If this is an OBSS frame, it compares the
 * received RSSI with its configured OBSS_PD level value. The PHY then gets reset to IDLE state
 * in case the received RSSI is lower than that constant OBSS PD level value, and is informed
 * about TX power restrictions that might be applied to the next tranmission.
