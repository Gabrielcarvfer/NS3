 *
 * This class implements the AMRR rate control algorithm which
 * was initially described in <i>IEEE 802.11 Rate Adaptation:
 * A Practical Approach</i>, by M. Lacage, M.H. Manshaei, and
 * T. Turletti.
 *
 * This RAA does not support HT or VHT modes and will error exit
 * if the user tries to configure this RAA with a Wi-Fi MAC that
 * has VhtSupported or HtSupported set.
