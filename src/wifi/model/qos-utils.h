 * range to the starting sequence number <i>startingSeq</i>. So this function works fine also
 * when <i>seqNumber</i> is smaller than <i>startingSeq</i> and <i>startingSeq</i> + 2048 is greater
 * than 4096 because all comparison are circular modulo 2^12. The following are possible scenarios:

 * +++++ = new packets

 *           | startingSeq    | endSeq
 *
 * Here in the examples endSeq is the sequenceNumber of the "last" new packet.
 * So this function, when specified a starting sequence and a sequence number, returns true
 * if that packet (with sequence number <i>numberSeq</i>)) belongs to the section of the
 * sequence number space marked with '-' characters. The function returns false otherwise.
