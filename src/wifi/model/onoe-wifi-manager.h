 * This algorithm is well known because it has been used as the default
 * rate control algorithm for the madwifi driver. I am not aware of
 * any publication or reference about this algorithm beyond the madwifi
 * source code.
 *
 * This RAA does not support HT or VHT modes and will error exit
 * if the user tries to configure this RAA with a Wi-Fi MAC that
 * has VhtSupported or HtSupported set.
