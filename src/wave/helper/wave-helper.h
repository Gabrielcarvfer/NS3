 * their attributes during creation.

 * Generally WaveHelper with default configuration will
 * create devices with 7 MAC entities,1 PHY entity and a
 * multiple-channel scheduler for to deal with these entities.
 *
 * If users can make sure on which channel this WAVE device
 * will work, they can set specific channel numbers to save
 * resources of unused channels as below:
 * WaveHelper helper = WaveHelper::Default ();
 * uint32_t channels[] = {CCH, SCH1};
 * std::vector<uint32_t> channelsVector (channels, channels + 2);
 * helper.helper.CreateMacForChannel (channelsVector);
 *
 * If users can create other channel scheduler such as "AnotherScheduler"
 * which can assign channel access in the context of  more PHY entities,
 * they can use this helper to create WAVE devices as below:
 * WaveHelper helper = WaveHelper::Default ();
 * helper.helper.CreateMacForChannel (ChannelManager::GetWaveChannels ());
 * helper.CreatePhys (2);        // or other number which should be less than 7
 * helper.SetChannelScheduler ("ns3::AnotherScheduler");
 * helper.SetRemoteStationManager ("ns3::ConstantRateWifiManager");  // or other  rate control algorithms
