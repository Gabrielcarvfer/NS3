/**
 * \ingroup wave
 * \brief The WaveBsmStats class implements a stats collector for
 * IEEE 1609 WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments)
 * Basic Safety Messages (BSMs).  The BSM is a ~200-byte packet that is
 * generally broadcast from every vehicle at a nominal rate of 10 Hz.
 *
 * \internal
 * Note:  This class collects data elements and accessors
 * along with methods that calculate metrics from the data
 * elements.  The data and metrics calculation algorithms
 * are collected together here purely to keep them together.
 * Future work may need to add additional metric calculations,
 * and for now, we are trying to keep all related data and
 * algorithms together, although these could easily be
 * refactored in the future and moved to separate classes.
 * However, it seems that for now, moving the data elements
 * or the algorithms separately into different classes could
 * lead to confusion over usage.

   * Note:
   * The WAVE Basic Safety Message (BSM) is broadcast and
   * unacknowledged. In order to calculate packet delivery
   * ratio (PDR), we must count i) the packets that are
   * actually received and ii) the transmitted packets that
   * are expected to be received.  Both are relative to a
   * specified (circular) coverage area.
   *
   * For example:  Say we have three nodes, A, B, and C, each
   * separated by 40m, as follows:
   *
   *    A --<40m>-- B --<40m>-- C
   *
   * Let's assume that the transmission range is 50m, and only
   * A is transmitting (i.e. broadcasting).  B can receive A's
   * broadcasts, while C cannot.  Let's assume no dropped packets.
   * If we set the coverage area to  100m, then the PDR is 50%,
   * because B receives every transmission from A, while C receives
   * none of them.  However, if we change the effective
   * coverage area to 75m then the PDR improves to 100%, because
   * B receives 100% of A's transmissions, and C is outside of the
   * coverage area, and so does not factor in to the PDR.
