/**
 * \ingroup mobility
 * \brief Waypoint-based mobility model.
 *
 * Each object determines its velocity and position at a given time
 * from a set of ns3::Waypoint objects.  Past waypoints are discarded
 * after the current simulation time greater than their time value.
 *
 * By default, the initial position of each object corresponds to the 
 * position of the first waypoint, and the initial velocity of each 
 * object is zero.  Upon reaching the last waypoint, object position 
 * becomes static and velocity is zero.
 *
 * When a node is in between waypoint times, it moves with a constant
 * velocity between the position at the previous waypoint and the position
 * at the current waypoint. To make a node hold a certain position for a
 * time interval, two waypoints with the same position (but different times)
 * should be inserted sequentially.
 *
 * Waypoints can be added at any time, and setting the current position
 * of an object will set its velocity to zero until the next waypoint time
 * (at which time the object jumps to the next waypoint), unless there are
 * no more waypoints in which case it will not change without user
 * intervention.
 *
 * The model has two attributes with methods that allow clients to get 
 * the next waypoint value (NextWaypoint) and the number of waypoints left 
 * (WaypointsLeft) beyond (but not including) the next waypoint.
 *
 * In addition, there are two attributes that govern model behavior.  The
 * first, LazyNotify, governs how the model calls the CourseChange trace.
 * By default, LazyNotify is false, which means that each time that a
 * waypoint time is hit, an Update() is forced and the CourseChange 
 * callback will be called.  When LazyNotify is true, Update() is suppressed
 * at waypoint times, and CourseChange callbacks will only occur when
 * there later are actual calls to Update () (typically when calling
 * GetPosition ()).  This option may be enabled for execution run-time
 * performance improvements, but when enabled, users should note that
 * course change listeners will in general not be notified at waypoint
 * times but instead at the next Update() following a waypoint time,
 * and some waypoints may not be notified to course change listeners.
 *
 * The second, InitialPositionIsWaypoint, is false by default.  Recall
 * that the first waypoint will set the initial position and set velocity
 * equal to 0 until the first waypoint time.  In such a case, the
 * call to SetPosition(), such as from a PositionAllocator, will be
 * ignored.  However, if InitialPositionIsWaypoint is set to true
 * and SetPosition() is called before any waypoints have been added,
 * the SetPosition() call is treated as an initial waypoint at time zero.
 * In such a case, when SetPosition() is treated as an initial waypoint,
 * it should be noted that attempts to add a waypoint at the same time
 * will cause the program to fail.
