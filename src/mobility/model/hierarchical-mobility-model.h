/**
 * \ingroup mobility
 * \brief Hierarchical mobility model.
 * 
 * This model allows you to specify the position of a child object
 * relative to a parent object.
 * 
 * Basically this is a mobility model that combines two other mobility
 * models: a "parent" model and a "child" model.  The position of the
 * hierarchical model is always the vector sum of the parent + child
 * positions, so that if the parent model "moves", then this model
 * will report an equal relative movement.  Useful, for instance, if
 * you want to simulate a node inside another node that moves, such as
 * a vehicle.
 *
 * Setting the position on this model is always done using world
 * absolute coordinates, and it changes only the child mobility model
 * position, never the parent.  The child mobility model always uses a
 * coordinate system relative to the parent model position.
 *
 * \note: as a special case, the parent model may be NULL, which is
 * semantically equivalent to having a ConstantPositionMobilityModel
 * as parent positioned at origin (0,0,0).  In other words, setting
 * the parent model to NULL makes the child model and the hierarchical
 * model start using world absolute coordinates.
 *
 * \warning: changing the parent/child mobility models in the middle
 * of a simulation will probably not play very well with the
 * ConfigStore APIs, so do this only if you know what you are doing.
