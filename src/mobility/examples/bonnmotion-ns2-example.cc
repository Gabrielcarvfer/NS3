/*
 * Example program using a ns-2-formatted mobility trace generated
 * by the BonnMotion mobility framework.
 *
 * With the provided tracefile (bonnmotion.ns_movements), the movements of 
 * one node are simulated for 1000 seconds.  There are a few other files
 * that provide metadata about the mobility:
 * - src/mobility/examples/bonnmotion.ns_params
 * - src/mobility/examples/bonnmotion.params
 *
 * These files are documented in the BonnMotion documentation.
 *
 * It is important to remember that the trace file dictates how many nodes
 * (in this case, one) and how long (in this case, 1000 seconds) that the
 * ns-3 program should use.  If you want to change the mobility pattern,
 * number of nodes, or duration, you need to use BonnMotion or another
 * tool to generate a new trace.
 *
 * Finally, note that you can visualize this program using the pyviz
 * visualizer:
 *  ./waf --run bonnmotion-ns2-example --vis
