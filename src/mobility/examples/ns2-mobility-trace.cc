 * This example demonstrates the use of Ns2MobilityHelper class to work with mobility.
 *
 * Detailed example description.
 *
 *  - intended usage: this should be used in order to load ns2 movement trace files into ns3.
 *  - behavior:
 *      - Ns2MobilityHelper object is created, associated to the specified trace file. 
 *      - A log file is created, using the log file name argument.
 *      - A node container is created with the number of nodes specified in the command line.  For the default ns-2 trace, specify the value 2 for this argument.
 *      - the program calls the Install() method of Ns2MobilityHelper to set mobility to nodes. At this moment, the file is read line by line, and the movement is scheduled in the simulator.
 *      - A callback is configured, so each time a node changes its course a log message is printed.
 *  - expected output: example prints out messages generated by each read line from the ns2 movement trace file.
 *                     For each line, it shows if the line is correct, or of it has errors and in this case it will
 *                     be ignored.
 *
 * Usage of ns2-mobility-trace:
 *
 *  ./waf --run "ns2-mobility-trace \
 *        --traceFile=src/mobility/examples/default.ns_movements
 *        --nodeNum=2  --duration=100.0 --logFile=ns2-mobility-trace.log"
 *
 *  NOTE: ns2-traces-file could be an absolute or relative path. You could use the file default.ns_movements
 *        included in the same directory as the example file.
 *  NOTE 2: Number of nodes present in the trace file must match with the command line argument.
 *          Note that you must know it before to be able to load it.
 *  NOTE 3: Duration must be a positive number and should match the trace file. Note that you must know it before to be able to load it.
