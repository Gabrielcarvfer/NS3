/**
 * \ingroup traffic-control
 *
 * QueueDisc is an abstract base class providing the interface and implementing
 * the operations common to all the queueing disciplines. Child classes
 * need to implement the methods used to enqueue a packet (DoEnqueue),
 * dequeue a single packet (DoDequeue), get a copy of the next packet
 * to extract (DoPeek), check whether the current configuration is correct
 * (CheckConfig).
 *
 * As in Linux, a queue disc may contain distinct elements:
 * - queues, which actually store the packets waiting for transmission
 * - classes, which allow to reserve a different treatment to different packets
 * - filters, which determine the queue or class which a packet is destined to
 *
 * Notice that a child queue disc must be attached to every class and a packet
 * filter is only able to classify packets of a single protocol. Also, while in Linux
 * some queue discs (e.g., fq-codel) use an internal classifier and do not make use of
 * packet filters, in ns-3 every queue disc including multiple queues or multiple classes
 * needs an external filter to classify packets (this is to avoid having the traffic-control
 * module depend on other modules such as internet).
 *
 * Queue disc configuration vary from queue disc to queue disc. A typical taxonomy divides
 * queue discs in classful (i.e., support classes) and classless (i.e., do not support
 * classes). More recently, after the appearance of multi-queue devices (such as Wifi),
 * some multi-queue aware queue discs have been introduced. Multi-queue aware queue discs
 * handle as many queues (or queue discs -- without using classes) as the number of
 * transmission queues used by the device on which the queue disc is installed.
 * An attempt is made, also, to enqueue each packet in the "same" queue both within the
 * queue disc and within the device.
 *
 * The traffic control layer interacts with a queue disc in a simple manner: after
 * requesting to enqueue a packet, the traffic control layer requests the qdisc to
 * "run", i.e., to dequeue a set of packets, until a predefined number ("quota")
 * of packets is dequeued or the netdevice stops the queue disc. A netdevice shall
 * stop the queue disc when its transmission queue does not have room for another
 * packet. Also, a netdevice shall wake the queue disc when it detects that there
 * is room for another packet in its transmission queue, but the transmission queue
 * is stopped. Waking a queue disc is equivalent to make it run.
 *
 * Every queue disc collects statistics about the total number of packets/bytes
 * received from the upper layers (in case of root queue disc) or from the parent
 * queue disc (in case of child queue disc), enqueued, dequeued, requeued, dropped,
 * dropped before enqueue, dropped after dequeue, queued in the queue disc and
 * sent to the netdevice or to the parent queue disc. Note that packets that are
 * dequeued may be requeued, i.e., retained by the traffic control infrastructure,
 * if the netdevice is not ready to receive them. Requeued packets are not part
 * of the queue disc. The following identities hold:
 * - dropped = dropped before enqueue + dropped after dequeue
 * - received = dropped before enqueue + enqueued
 * - queued = enqueued - dequeued
 * - sent = dequeued - dropped after dequeue (- 1 if there is a requeued packet)
 *
 * Separate counters are also kept for each possible reason to drop a packet.
 * When a packet is dropped by an internal queue, e.g., because the queue is full,
 * the reason is "Dropped by internal queue". When a packet is dropped by a child
 * queue disc, the reason is "(Dropped by child queue disc) " followed by the
 * reason why the child queue disc dropped the packet.
 *
 * The QueueDisc base class provides the SojournTime trace source, which provides
 * the sojourn time of every packet dequeued from a queue disc, including packets
 * that are dropped or requeued after being dequeued. The sojourn time is taken
 * when the packet is dequeued from the queue disc, hence it does not account for
 * the additional time the packet is retained within the traffic control
 * infrastructure in case it is requeued.
 *
 * The design and implementation of this class is heavily inspired by Linux.
 * For more details, see the traffic-control model page.
