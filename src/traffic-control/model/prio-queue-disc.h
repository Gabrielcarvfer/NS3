 * The Prio qdisc is a simple classful queueing discipline that contains an
 * arbitrary number of classes of differing priority. The classes are dequeued
 * in numerical descending order of priority. By default, three Fifo queue
 * discs are created, unless the user provides (at least two) child queue
 * discs.
 *
 * If no packet filter is installed or able to classify a packet, then the
 * packet is assigned a priority band based on its priority (modulo 16), which
 * is used as an index into an array called priomap. If a packet is classified
 * by a packet filter and the returned value is non-negative and less than the
 * number of priority bands, then the packet is assigned the priority band
 * corresponding to the value returned by the packet filter. Otherwise, the
 * packet is assigned the priority band specified by the first element of the
 * priomap array.
