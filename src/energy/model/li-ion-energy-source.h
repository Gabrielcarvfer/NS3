/**
 * \ingroup energy
 * \brief Model a generic Lithium Ion Battery basing on [1][2].
 *
 * The model can be fitted to any type of Li-Ion Battery, simply changing the
 * model parameters.
 * The default values are fitted for the Panasonic CGR18650DA Li-Ion Battery [3].
 *
 * The energy is drained as defined from the EnergySource interface but, this class
 * consider the non-linear behaviour of Li-Ion cell. Each time energy is drained from
 * the cell, the class evaluates the discharge curve to get the actual cell's voltage,
 * accordingly to State of Charge (SOC) and current's drain.
 *
 * If the actual voltage of the cell goes below the minimum threshold voltage, the
 * cell is considered depleted and the energy drained event fired up.
 *
 *
 * The model requires several parameters to approximates the discharge curves:
 * - IntialCellVoltage, maximum voltage of the fully charged cell
 * - NominalCellVoltage, nominal cell's voltage, is used to determine the end of the
 *   nominal zone.
 * - ExpCellVoltage, cell's voltage at the end of the exponential zone
 * - RatedCapacity, rated capacity of the cell, in Ah
 * - NomCapacity, cell's capacity at the end of the nominal zone, in Ah
 * - ExpCapacity, cell's capacity at the end of the exponential zone, in Ah
 * - InternalResistance, internal resistance of the cell, in Ohms
 * - TypCurrent, typical discharge current value, used during the fitting process, in Ah
 * - ThresholdVoltage, minimum threshold voltage below which the cell is considered
 *   depleted
 *
 * For a complete reference of the energy source model and model's fitting please refer
 * to <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSOC2010UANFramework">UAN Framework</a>
 * page and <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Li-Ion_model_fitting">Li-Ion model
