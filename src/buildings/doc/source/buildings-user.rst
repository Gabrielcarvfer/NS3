How to use buildings in a simulation
====================================

In this section we explain the basic usage of the buildings model within a
simulation program.

Include the headers
*******************

Add this at the beginning of your simulation program::

   #include <ns3/buildings-module.h>


Create a building
*****************

As an example, let's create a residential 10 x 20 x 10 building::

    double x_min = 0.0;
    double x_max = 10.0;
    double y_min = 0.0;
    double y_max = 20.0;
    double z_min = 0.0;
    double z_max = 10.0;
    Ptr<Building> b = CreateObject <Building> ();
    b->SetBoundaries (Box (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max));
    b->SetBuildingType (Building::Residential);
    b->SetExtWallsType (Building::ConcreteWithWindows);
    b->SetNFloors (3);
    b->SetNRoomsX (3);
    b->SetNRoomsY (2);

This building has three floors and an internal 3 x 2  grid of rooms of equal size.

The helper class GridBuildingAllocator is also available to easily
create a set of buildings with identical characteristics placed on a
rectangular grid. Here's an example of how to use it::

  Ptr<GridBuildingAllocator>  gridBuildingAllocator;
  gridBuildingAllocator = CreateObject<GridBuildingAllocator> ();
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetAttribute ("GridWidth", UintegerValue (3));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetAttribute ("LengthX", DoubleValue (7)); 
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetAttribute ("LengthY", DoubleValue (13));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetAttribute ("DeltaX", DoubleValue (3));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetAttribute ("DeltaY", DoubleValue (3));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetAttribute ("Height", DoubleValue (6));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetBuildingAttribute ("NRoomsX", UintegerValue (2));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetBuildingAttribute ("NRoomsY", UintegerValue (4));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetBuildingAttribute ("NFloors", UintegerValue (2));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetAttribute ("MinX", DoubleValue (0));
  gridBuildingAllocator->SetAttribute ("MinY", DoubleValue (0));
  gridBuildingAllocator->Create (6);


This will create a 3x2 grid of 6 buildings, each 7 x 13 x 6 m with 2 x
4 rooms inside and 2 foors; the buildings are spaced by 3 m on both
the x and the y axis. 


Setup nodes and mobility models
*******************************

Nodes and mobility models are configured as usual, however in order to
use them with the buildings model you need an additional call to
``BuildingsHelper::Install()``, so as to let the mobility model include
the informtion on their position w.r.t. the buildings. Here is an example::

    MobilityHelper mobility;
    mobility.SetMobilityModel ("ns3::ConstantPositionMobilityModel");
    ueNodes.Create (2);
    mobility.Install (ueNodes);
    BuildingsHelper::Install (ueNodes);

It is to be noted that any mobility model can be used. However, the
user is advised to make sure that the behavior of the mobility model
being used is consistent with the presence of Buildings. For example,
using a simple random mobility over the whole simulation area in
presence of buildings might easily results in node moving in and out
of buildings, regardless of the presence of walls. 


Place some nodes
****************

You can place nodes in your simulation using several methods, which
are described in the following.

Legacy positioning methods
--------------------------

Any legacy ns-3 positioning method can be used to place node in the
simulation. The important additional step is to For example, you can
place nodes manually like this::

    Ptr<ConstantPositionMobilityModel> mm0 = enbNodes.Get (0)->GetObject<ConstantPositionMobilityModel> ();
    Ptr<ConstantPositionMobilityModel> mm1 = enbNodes.Get (1)->GetObject<ConstantPositionMobilityModel> ();
    mm0->SetPosition (Vector (5.0, 5.0, 1.5));
    mm1->SetPosition (Vector (30.0, 40.0, 1.5));

    MobilityHelper mobility;
    mobility.SetMobilityModel ("ns3::ConstantPositionMobilityModel");
    ueNodes.Create (2);
    mobility.Install (ueNodes);
    BuildingsHelper::Install (ueNodes);
    mm0->SetPosition (Vector (5.0, 5.0, 1.5));
    mm1->SetPosition (Vector (30.0, 40.0, 1.5));

Alternatively, you could use any existing PositionAllocator
class. The coordinates of the node will determine whether it is placed
outdoor or indoor and, if indoor, in which building and room it is placed.


Building-specific positioning methods
-------------------------------------

The following position allocator classes are available to place node
in special positions with respect to buildings:

 - ``RandomBuildingPositionAllocator``: Allocate each position by
   randomly chosing a building from the list of all buildings, and
   then randomly chosing a position inside the building. 

 - ``RandomRoomPositionAllocator``: Allocate each position by randomly
   chosing a room from the list of rooms in all buildings, and then
   randomly chosing a position inside the room. 

 - ``SameRoomPositionAllocator``: Walks a given NodeContainer
   sequentially, and for each node allocate a new position randomly in
   the same room of that node.  

 - ``FixedRoomPositionAllocator``: Generate a random position
   uniformly distributed in the volume of a chosen room inside a
   chosen building.   



Make the Mobility Model Consistent
**********************************

**Important**: whenever you use buildings, you have to issue the
following command after we have placed all nodes and buildings in the simulation::

    BuildingsHelper::MakeMobilityModelConsistent ();

This command will go through the lists of all nodes and of all
buildings, determine for each user if it is indoor or outdoor, and if
indoor it will also determine the building in which the user is
located and the corresponding floor and number inside the building. 


Building-aware pathloss model
*****************************

After you placed buildings and nodes in a simulation, you can use a
building-aware pathloss model in a simulation exactly in the same way
you would use any regular path loss model. How to do this is specific
for the wireless module that you are considering (lte, wifi, wimax,
etc.), so please refer to the documentation of that model for specific
instructions.




Main configurable attributes
============================

The ``Building`` class has the following configurable parameters:

* building type: Residential, Office and Commercial.
* external walls type: Wood, ConcreteWithWindows, ConcreteWithoutWindows and StoneBlocks.
* building bounds: a ``Box`` class with the building bounds.
* number of floors.
* number of rooms in x-axis and y-axis (rooms can be placed only in a grid way).

The ``BuildingMobilityLossModel`` parameter configurable with the ns3 attribute system is represented by the bound (string ``Bounds``) of the simulation area by providing a ``Box`` class with the area bounds. Moreover, by means of its methos the following parameters can be configured:

* the number of floor the node is placed (default 0).
* the position in the rooms grid.


The ``BuildingPropagationLossModel`` class has the following configurable parameters configurable with the attribute system:

* ``Frequency``: reference frequency (default 2160 MHz), note that by setting the frequency the wavelength is set accordingly automatically and viceversa).
* ``Lambda``: the wavelength (0.139 meters, considering the above frequency).
* ``ShadowSigmaOutdoor``: the standard deviation of the shadowing for outdoor nodes (defaul 7.0).
* ``ShadowSigmaIndoor``: the standard deviation of the shadowing for indoor nodes (default 8.0).
* ``ShadowSigmaExtWalls``: the standard deviation of the shadowing due to external walls penetration for outdoor to indoor communications (default 5.0).
* ``RooftopLevel``: the level of the rooftop of the building in meters (default 20 meters).
* ``Los2NlosThr``: the value of distance of the switching point between line-of-sigth and non-line-of-sight propagation model in meters (default 200 meters).
* ``ITU1411DistanceThr``: the value of distance of the switching point between short range (ITU 1211) communications and long range (Okumura Hata) in meters (default 200 meters).
* ``MinDistance``: the minimum distance in meters between two nodes for evaluating the pathloss (considered neglictible before this threshold) (default 0.5 meters).
* ``Environment``: the environment scenario among Urban, SubUrban and OpenAreas (default Urban).
* ``CitySize``: the dimension of the city among Small, Medium, Large (default Large).

In order to use the hybrid mode, the class to be used is the ``HybridBuildingMobilityLossModel``, which allows the selection of the proper pathloss model according to the pathloss logic presented in the design chapter. However, this solution has the problem that the pathloss model switching points might present discontinuities due to the different characteristics of the model. This implies that according to the specific scenario, the threshold used for switching have to be properly tuned.
The simple ``OhBuildingMobilityLossModel`` overcome this problem by using only the Okumura Hata model and the wall penetration losses.
