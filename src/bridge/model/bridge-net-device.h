/**
 * \defgroup bridge Bridge Network Device
 * 
 * \brief a virtual net device that bridges multiple LAN segments
 *
 * The BridgeNetDevice object is a "virtual" netdevice that aggregates
 * multiple "real" netdevices and implements the data plane forwarding
 * part of IEEE 802.1D.  By adding a BridgeNetDevice to a Node, it
 * will act as a "bridge", or "switch", to multiple LAN segments.
 * 
 * By default the bridge netdevice implements a "learning bridge"
 * algorithm (see 802.1D), where incoming unicast frames from one port
 * may occasionally be forwarded throughout all other ports, but
 * usually they are forwarded only to a single correct output port.
 *
 * \attention The Spanning Tree Protocol part of 802.1D is not
 * implemented.  Therefore, you have to be careful not to create
 * bridging loops, or else the network will collapse.
 *
 * \attention Bridging is designed to work only with NetDevices
 * modelling IEEE 802-style technologies, such as CsmaNetDevice and
 * WifiNetDevice.
 *
 * \attention If including a WifiNetDevice in a bridge, the wifi
 * device must be in Access Point mode.  Adhoc mode is not supported
 * with bridging.
