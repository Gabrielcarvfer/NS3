 * This struct provides the generic signal representation to be used by
 * all wireless technologies. Any specific wireless technology is
 * allowed to define additional signal parameters by inheriting from this
 * struct and providing additional member variables. This makes sure
 * that a minimum set of parameters (in particular, the ones needed
 * for interference calculation) is
 * common across all wireless technologies, while at the same time
 * allowing each technology to have its own specific signal parameters.
 *
 * Furthermore, since the signal parameters specific of every technology inherit
 * directly from this struct, each PHY can test (by using a dynamic
 * cast) if a signal being received belongs to a given technology or not.
 *
 * \note when inheriting from this class, make sure that the assignment operator and the copy constructor work properly, making deep copies if needed.
