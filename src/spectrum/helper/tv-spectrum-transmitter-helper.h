 * Helper class which uses TvSpectrumTransmitter class to create customizable

 * Provides method to create a random set of transmitters within a given region

 *
 * Here is an example of how to use this class:
 * \code
   TvSpectrumTransmitterHelper tvTransHelper;
   tvTransHelper.SetChannel (channel); // provided that user has a Ptr<SpectrumChannel> ready.
   tvTransHelper.SetAttribute ("StartFrequency", DoubleValue (524e6));
