 * \brief General error model that can be used to corrupt packets
 *
 * This object is used to flag packets as being lost/errored or not.
 * It is part of the Object framework and can be aggregated to 
 * other ns3 objects and handled by the Ptr class.
 *
 * The main method is IsCorrupt(Ptr<Packet> p) which returns true if 
 * the packet is to be corrupted according to the underlying model.
 * Depending on the error model, the packet itself may have its packet
 * data buffer errored or not, or side information may be returned to
 * the client in the form of a packet tag.  (Note:  No such error models
 * that actually error the bits in a packet presently exist).
 * The object can have state (resettable by Reset()).
 * The object can also be enabled and disabled via two public member functions.
 * 
 * Typical code (simplified) to use an ErrorModel may look something like 
 * this:
 * \code 
 * Ptr<ErrorModel> rem = CreateObject<RateErrorModel> ();
 * Ptr<UniformRandomVariable> uv = CreateObject<UniformRandomVariable> ();
 * rem->SetRandomVariable (uv);
 * rem->SetRate (0.001);
 * ...
 * Ptr<Packet> p;
 * if (rem->IsCorrupt (p))
 *   {
 *     dropTrace(p);
 *   } else {
 *     Forward (p);
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Four practical error models, a RateErrorModel, a BurstErrorModel, 
 * a ListErrorModel, and a ReceiveListErrorModel, are currently implemented.

 * \brief Determine which bursts of packets are errored corresponding to 
 * an underlying distribution, burst rate, and burst size.
 *
 * This object is used to flag packets as being lost/errored or not.
 * The two parameters that govern the behavior are the burst rate (or
 * equivalently, the mean duration/spacing between between error events), 
 * and the burst size (or equivalently, the number of packets being flagged 
 * as errored at each error event).
 *
 * Users can optionally provide RandomVariableStream objects;
 * the default for the decision variable is to use a Uniform(0,1) distribution;
 * the default for the burst size (number of packets) is to use a 
 * discrete Uniform[1,4] distribution.
 *
 * For every packet, the model generates a random number based on the 
 * decision variable, and compares it with the burst error rate to 
 * determine if a burst error event should occur.
 * If a new error event occurs, the model to will generate a new burst size 
 * to determine how many packets should be dropped in this particular burst
 * error event in addition to the current packet.
 *
 * When a second packet arrives, the model again determines if a new error 
 * event should occur based on a newly generated decision variable and 
 * the burst error rate. If a new error event is determined to occur, 
 * the model will restart with a new burst size. Otherwise, the model will
 * resume the last error event and drop the packet provided that the 
 * total number of packets that has been dropped does not exceed the 
 * burst size.
