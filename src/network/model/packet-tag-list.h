 *
 *   - Tags are stored in serialized form in a tree of TagData
 *     structures. (<tt>T1-T7</tt> in the diagram)
 *
 *   - Each TagData points (\c next pointers in the diagram)
 *     toward the root of the tree, which is a null pointer.
 *
 *   - \c count is the number of incoming pointers to this
 *     TagData.  Branch points, where branches merge or join, have
 *     <tt>count \> 1</tt> (\c T3, \c T5); successive links along
 *     a branch have <tt>count = 1</tt> (\c T1, \c T2, \c T4, \c T6, \c T7).
 *
 *   - Each PacketTagList points to a specific TagData,
 *     which is the most recent Tag added to the packet. (<tt>T5-T7</tt>)
 *
 *   - Conceptually, therefore, each Packet has a PacketTagList which
 *     points to a singly-linked list of TagData.
 *
 * \par <b> Copy-on-write </b> is implemented as follows:
 *
 *   - #Add prepends the new tag to the list (growing that branch of the tree,
 *     as \c T6). This is a constant time operation, and does not affect
 *     any other #PacketTagList's, hence this is a \c const function.
 *
 *   - Copy constructor (PacketTagList(const PacketTagList & o))
 *     and assignment (#operator=(const PacketTagList & o))
 *     simply join the tree at the same place as the original
 *     PacketTagList \c o, incrementing the \c count.
 *     For assignment, the old branch is deleted, up to
 *     the first branch point, which has its \c count decremented.
 *     (PacketTagList \c B started as a copy of PacketTagList \c A,
 *     before \c T6 was added to \c B).
 *
 *   - #Remove and #Replace are a little tricky, depending on where the
 *     target tag is found relative to the first branch point:
 *     - \e Target before <em> the first branch point: </em> \n
 *       The target is just dealt with in place (linked around and deleted,
 *       in the case of #Remove; rewritten in the case of #Replace).
 *     - \e Target at or after <em> the first branch point: </em> \n
 *       The portion of the list between the first branch and the target is
 *       shared. This portion is copied before the #Remove or #Replace is
 *       performed.
