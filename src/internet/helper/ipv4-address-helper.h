 *
 * This class is a very simple IPv4 address generator.  You can think of it
 * as a simple local number incrementer.  It has no notion that IP addresses
 * are part of a global address space.  If you have a complicated address 
 * assignment situation you may want to look at the Ipv4AddressGenerator which
 * does recognize that IP address and network number generation is part of a
 * global problem.  Ipv4AddressHelper is a simple class to make simple problems
 * easy to handle.
 *
 * We do call into the global address generator to make sure that there are
 * no duplicate addresses generated.

 * address parts, SetBase was given an initial network number value, a network
 * mask and an initial address base.
 *
 * This method increments the network number and resets the IP address
 * counter to the last base value used.  For example, if the network number was
 * set to 192.168.0.0 with a mask of 255.255.255.0 and a base address of

 * IP address counter is reset to the initial value specified in SetBase.  In 
 * this case, that would be 0.0.0.3. so if you were to call NewAddress after
 * the increment that resulted in a network number of 192.168.2.0, the 
 * allocated addresses returned by NewAddress would be 192.168.2.3,

 * address parts, SetBase was given an initial value and a network mask.
 * The one bits of this mask define the prefix category from which the helper

 * each net device in the container, the helper finds the associated node and
 * looks up the Ipv4 interface corresponding to the net device.  It then sets
 * the Ipv4Address and mask in the interface to the appropriate values.  If
