/**
 * \ingroup ipv4
 *
 * \brief holds a vector of std::pair of Ptr<Ipv4> and interface index.
 *
 * Typically ns-3 Ipv4Interfaces are installed on devices using an Ipv4 address
 * helper.  The helper's Assign() method takes a NetDeviceContainer which holds 
 * some number of Ptr<NetDevice>.  For each of the NetDevices in the 
 * NetDeviceContainer the helper will find the associated Ptr<Node> and
 * Ptr<Ipv4>.  It makes sure that an interface exists on the node for the 
 * device and then adds an Ipv4Address according to the address helper settings
 * (incrementing the Ipv4Address somehow as it goes).  The helper then converts
 * the Ptr<Ipv4> and the interface index to a std::pair and adds them to a 
 * container -- a container of this type.
 *
 * The point is then to be able to implicitly associate an index into the 
 * original NetDeviceContainer (that identifies a particular net device) with
 * an identical index into the Ipv4InterfaceContainer that has a std::pair with
 * the Ptr<Ipv4> and interface index you need to play with the interface.
 *
