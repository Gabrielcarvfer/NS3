 * library that provides ported TCP stacks from popular operating systems
 * such as Linux and FreeBSD.  Glue code such as the ns-3 NSC code
 * allows users to delegate Internet stack processing to the logic
 * from these operating systems.  This allows a user to reproduce
 * with high fidelity the behavior of a real TCP stack.
