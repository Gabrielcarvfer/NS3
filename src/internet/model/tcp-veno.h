/**
 * \ingroup congestionOps
 *
 * \brief An implementation of TCP Veno
 *
 * TCP Veno enhances Reno algorithm for more effectively dealing with random
 * packet loss in wireless access networks by employing Vegas's method in
 * estimating the backlog at the bottleneck queue to distinguish between
 * congestive and non-congestive states.
 *
 * The backlog (the number of packets accumulated at the bottleneck queue) is
 * calculated using Equation (1):
 *
 *         N = Actual * (RTT - BaseRTT) = Diff * BaseRTT        (1)
 * where
 *         Diff = Expected - Actual = cwnd/BaseRTT - cwnd/RTT
 *
 * Veno makes decision on cwnd modification based on the calculated N and its
 * predefined threshold beta.
 *
 * Specifically, it refines the additive increase algorithm of Reno so that the
 * connection can stay longer in the stable state by incrementing cwnd by
 * 1/cwnd for every other new ACK received after the available bandwidth has
 * been fully utilized, i.e. when N exceeds beta.  Otherwise, Veno increases
 * its cwnd by 1/cwnd upon every new ACK receipt as in Reno.
 *
 * In the multiplicative decrease algorithm, when Veno is in the non-congestive
 * state, i.e. when N is less than beta, Veno decrements its cwnd by only 1/5
 * because the loss encountered is more likely a corruption-based loss than a
 * congestion-based.  Only when N is greater than beta, Veno halves its sending
 * rate as in Reno.
 *
