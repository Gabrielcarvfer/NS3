/**
 * \ingroup tcp
 *
 * \brief Rx reordering buffer for TCP
 *
 * The class is responsible to safely store the segments, and then
 * returning them in-order to the application, where "in-order" does not means
 * "network-order", but "sender-order" : the bytes should be returned in the
 * same order that the sender application used to push them down on wire.
 *
 * The first useful sequence that this class is waiting is returned by the method
 * NextRxSequence, and could be set at the beginning through MaxRxSequence.
 *
 * The max. size of this buffer is managed through SetMaxBufferSize, and could be
 * retrieved using MaxBufferSize. The current size instead is returned by
 * Size, while the amount of in-order data that could be extracted is returned
 * by the method Available.
 *
 * To store data, use Add; for retrieving a certain amount of ordered data, use
 * the method Extract.
 *
 * SACK list
 * ---------
 *
 * An interesting feature of this class is the ability to mantain an ordered
 * SACK list, under the definition of RFC 2018. When a out-of-order segment
 * reaches this buffer, an ACK will be sent out, and the SACK list is
 * generated or updated. From RFC 2018:
 *
 * > If sent at all, SACK options SHOULD be included in all ACKs which do
 * > not ACK the highest sequence number in the data receiver's queue.
 *
 * For more information about the SACK list, please check the documentation of
 * the method GetSackList.
 *
 * \see GetSackList
 * \see UpdateSackList
