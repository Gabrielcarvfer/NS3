 *
 * Corresponds to Linux struct in_ifaddr.  A list of these addresses
 * is stored in Ipv4Interface.  This class is modelled after how current
 * Linux handles IP aliasing for IPv4.  Notably, aliasing of IPv4 
 * interfaces (e.g., "eth0:1") is not used, and instead an interface
 * is assigned possibly multiple addresses, with each address being
 * classified as being primary and secondary.  See the iproute2 
 * documentation for this distinction.
