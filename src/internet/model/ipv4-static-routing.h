 * \brief Add a multicast route to the static routing table.
 *
 * A multicast route must specify an origin IP address, a multicast group and
 * an input network interface index as conditions and provide a vector of
 * output network interface indices over which packets matching the conditions
 * are sent.
 *
 * Typically there are two main types of multicast routes:  routes of the 
 * first kind are used during forwarding.  All of the conditions must be
 * explicitly provided.  The second kind of routes are used to get packets off
 * of a local node.  The difference is in the input interface.  Routes for
 * forwarding will always have an explicit input interface specified.  Routes
 * off of a node will always set the input interface to a wildcard specified
 * by the index Ipv4RoutingProtocol::INTERFACE_ANY.
 *
 * For routes off of a local node wildcards may be used in the origin and
 * multicast group addresses.  The wildcard used for Ipv4Adresses is that 
 * address returned by Ipv4Address::GetAny () -- typically "0.0.0.0".  Usage
 * of a wildcard allows one to specify default behavior to varying degrees.
 *
 * For example, making the origin address a wildcard, but leaving the 
 * multicast group specific allows one (in the case of a node with multiple
 * interfaces) to create different routes using different output interfaces
 * for each multicast group.
 *
 * If the origin and multicast addresses are made wildcards, you have created
 * essentially a default multicast address that can forward to multiple 
 * interfaces.  Compare this to the actual default multicast address that is
 * limited to specifying a single output interface for compatibility with
 * existing functionality in other systems.
 * 
 * \param origin The Ipv4Address of the origin of packets for this route.  May
 * be Ipv4Address:GetAny for open groups.
 * \param group The Ipv4Address of the multicast group or this route.
 * \param inputInterface The input network interface index over which to 
 * expect packets destined for this route.  May be
 * Ipv4RoutingProtocol::INTERFACE_ANY for packets of local origin.
 * \param outputInterfaces A vector of network interface indices used to specify
 * how to send packets to the destination(s).
