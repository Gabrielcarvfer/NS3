 * \ingroup wimax
 * \brief This class implements a simple downlink scheduler for rtPS flows.
 *
 * The DL-rtPS-Scheduler assigns the available bandwidth the service flows
 * in the following order: IR Connections, Broadcast Connections, Basic and
 * Primary Connections, UGS Connections, rtPS Connections, nrtPS Connections,
 * BE Connections.
 * The IR, Broadcast and Basic/Primary Connections must transmit
 * all packet in the queue. The UGS flows can transmit the quota of date equal to
 * the "Grant Size" (that is one of service flows QoS parameters) according to their
 * requested MaxLatency (another QoS parameter).
 * All rtPS flows are able to transmit all packet in the queue according to the available
 * bandwidth. The bandwidth saturation control has been implemented to redistribute
 *the effective available bandwidth to all rtPS flows that have at least one packet
 * to transmit. The remaining bandwidth is allocated to rntPS and BE Connections.
