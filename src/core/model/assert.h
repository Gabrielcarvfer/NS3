 * \brief Assert functions and macros
 *
 * The assert macros are used to verify
 * at runtime that a certain condition is true. If it is
 * not true, the program halts. These checks are built
 * into the program only in debugging builds. They are
 * removed in optimized builds.
 *
 * These macro are intended to check certain conditions
 * to be true. Do not put code that also have side effects
 * that your program relies on (eg. code that advances
 * an iterator and return false at end of file) because
 * the code will not be executed on release builds!!
 *
 * If assertion-style checks are required for release
 * builds, use NS_ABORT_UNLESS and NS_ABORT_MSG_UNLESS.
