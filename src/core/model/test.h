/**

 * \brief Test that actual and expected (limit) values are equal to
 * plus or minus some tolerance and report and abort if not.
 *
 * Check to see if the expected (limit) value is equal to the actual
 * value found in a test case to some tolerance.  This is not the same
 * thing as asking if two floating point are equal to within some
 * epsilon, but is useful for that case.  This assertion is geared
 * toward more of a measurement problem.  Consider measuring a
 * physical rod of some kind that you have ordered.  You need to
 * determine if it is "good."  You want to measure the rod to an
 * arbitrary precision of sixteen significant figures, you will
 * measure the rod to determine if its length is within the tolerances
 * you provided.  For example, 12.00 inches plus or minus .005 inch
 * may be just fine.
 * 
 * In ns-3, you might want to measure a signal to noise ratio and
 * check to see if the answer is what you expect.  If you naively
 * measure (double)1128.93 and compare this number with a constant
 * 1128.93 you are almost certainly going to have your test fail
 * because of floating point rounding errors.  We provide a floating
 * point comparison function ns3::TestDoubleIsEqual() but you will
 * probably quickly find that is not what you want either.  It may
 * turn out to be the case that when you measured an SNR that printed
 * as 1128.93, what was actually measured was something more like
 * 1128.9287653857625442 for example.  Given that the double epsilon
 * is on the order of 0.0000000000000009, you would need to provide
 * sixteen significant figures of expected value for this kind of test
 * to pass even with a typical test for floating point "approximate
 * equality."  That is clearly not required or desired.  You really
 * want to be able to provide 1128.93 along with a tolerance just like
 * you provided 12 inches +- 0.005 inch above.
 *
 * This assertion is designed for real measurements by taking into
 * account measurement tolerances.  By doing so it also automatically
 * compensates for floating point rounding errors.  If you really want
 * to check floating point equality down to the
 * numeric_limits<double>::epsilon () range, consider using
 * ns3::TestDoubleIsEqual().
 *
 * \note Mixing signed and unsigned types can lead to misleading
 * results.
 *
 * The message is interpreted as a stream, for example:
 *
 * \code
 *   NS_TEST_ASSERT_MSG_EQ_TOL (snr, 1128.93, 0.005,
 *                              "wrong snr (" << snr << ") in test");
 * \endcode
 *
 * is legal.

 * Check to see if the expected (limit) value is equal to the actual
 * value found in a test case to some tolerance.  This is not the same
 * thing as asking if two floating point are equal to within some
 * epsilon, but is useful for that case.  This assertion is geared
 * toward more of a measurement problem.  Consider measuring a
 * physical rod of some kind that you have ordered.  You need to
 * determine if it is "good."  You want to measure the rod to an
 * arbitrary precision of sixteen significant figures, you will
 * measure the rod to determine if its length is within the tolerances
 * you provided.  For example, 12.00 inches plus or minus .005 inch
 * may be just fine.
 * 
 * In ns-3, you might want to measure a signal to noise ratio and
 * check to see if the answer is what you expect.  If you naively
 * measure (double)1128.93 and compare this number with a constant
 * 1128.93 you are almost certainly going to have your test fail
 * because of floating point rounding errors.  We provide a floating
 * point comparison function ns3::TestDoubleIsEqual() but you will
 * probably quickly find that is not what you want either.  It may
 * turn out to be the case that when you measured an SNR that printed
 * as 1128.93, what was actually measured was something more like
 * 1128.9287653857625442 for example.  Given that the double epsilon
 * is on the order of 0.0000000000000009, you would need to provide
 * sixteen significant figures of expected value for this kind of test
 * to pass even with a typical test for floating point "approximate
 * equality."  That is clearly not required or desired.  You really
 * want to be able to provide 1128.93 along with a tolerance just like
 * you provided 12 inches +- 0.005 inch above.
 *
 * This assertion is designed for real measurements by taking into
 * account measurement tolerances.  By doing so it also automatically
 * compensates for floating point rounding errors.  If you really want
 * to check floating point equality down to the
