// In Linux, the basic timekeeping unit is derived from a variable called HZ
// HZ is the frequency in hertz of the system timer.  The system timer fires 
// every 1/HZ seconds and a counter, called the jiffies counter is incremented
// at each tick.  The time between ticks is called a jiffy (American slang for
// a short period of time).  The ticking of the jiffies counter is how the
// the kernel tells time.
//
// Now, the shortest time the kernel can sleep is one jiffy since a timer
// has to be set to expire and trigger the process to be made ready.  The
// Posix clock CLOCK_REALTIME is defined as a 1/HZ clock, so by doing a
// clock_getres () on the realtime clock we can infer the scheduler quantum
// and the minimimum sleep time for the system.  This is most certainly NOT
// going to be one nanosecond even though clock_nanosleep () pretends it is.
//
// The reason this number is important is that we are going to schedule lots
// of waits for less time than a jiffy.  The clock_nanosleep function is
// going to guarantee that it will sleep for AT LEAST the time specified.
// The least time that it will sleep is a jiffy.
//
// In order to deal with this, we are going to do a spin-wait if the simulator
// requires a delay less than a jiffy.  This is on the order of one millisecond
// (999848 ns) on the ns-regression machine.
// 
// If the underlying OS does not support posix clocks, we'll just assume a 
// one millisecond quantum and deal with this as best we can

// This is the belly of the beast.  We have received two parameters from the

//
// The first thing we need to do is to (try and) correct for any realtime 
// drift that has happened in the system.  In this implementation, we realize 
// that all mechanisms for drift will cause the drift to be such that the 
// realtime is greater than the simulation time.  This typically happens when 
// our process is put to sleep for a given time, but actually sleeps for
// longer.  So, what we want to do is to "catch up" to realtime and delay for
// less time than we are actually asked to delay.  DriftCorrect will return a 
// number from 0 to nsDelay corresponding to the amount of catching-up we
// need to do.  If we are more than nsDelay behind, we do not wait at all.
//
// Note that it will be impossible to catch up if the amount of drift is 
// cumulatively greater than the amount of delay between events.  The method
// GetDrift () is available to clients of the syncrhonizer to keep track of
// the cumulative drift.  The client can assert if the drift gets out of 
// hand, print warning messages, or just ignore the situation and hope it will

// explained.
//
// Here, I'll just say that we need that the jiffy is the minimum resolution 
// of the system clock.  It can only sleep in blocks of time equal to a jiffy.
// If we want to be more accurate than a jiffy (we do) then we need to sleep

// immediately below reflects the fact that a sleep is actually quite probably
// going to end up sleeping for some number of jiffies longer than you wanted.
// This is because your system is going to be off doing other unimportant 
// stuff during that extra time like running file systems and networks.  What
// we want to do is to ask the system to sleep enough less than the requested
// delay so that it comes back early most of the time (coming back early is
// fine, coming back late is bad).  If we can convince the system to come back
// early (most of the time), then we can busy-wait until the requested
// completion time actually comes around (most of the time).
//
// The tradeoff here is, of course, that the less time we spend sleeping, the
// more accurately we will sync up; but the more CPU time we will spend busy
// waiting (doing nothing).
