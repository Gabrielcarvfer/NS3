/**
 * @ingroup thread
 * @brief A class which provides a relatively platform-independent 
 * conditional-wait thread synchronization primitive.
 *
 * It is often desirable to have a mechanism by which a thread can suspend its
 * execution and relinquish the process until some condition to becomes true.
 * We provide platform-independent access to this OS-dependent capability with
 * the SystemCondition class.
 *
 * There are two ways to tell the underlying primitive that the condition has
 * become true:  Signal and Broadcast.  Signal will only wake up one thread
 * waiting on the condition (according to the OS scheduling policy); 
 * Broadcast will wake up all of the threads waiting on the condition 
 * (cf. "The Thundering Herd").
 * 
 * In order to wait for the underlying condition, you also have two
 * alternatives:  Wait and TimedWait.  The Wait call will wait forever for the
 * condition to become true; but the TimedWait has a timeout.
 *
 * The condition underlying this class is a simple boolean variable.  It is
 * set to false in each call to Wait and TimedWait.  It is set to true in each
 * call to Signal and Broadcast.  This is a fairly simple-minded condition
 * designed for 
 *
 * A typical use case will be to call Wait() or TimedWait() in one thread
 * context and put the processor to sleep until an event happens somewhere 
 * else that
