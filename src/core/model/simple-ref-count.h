/**
 * \ingroup ptr
 * \brief A template-based reference counting class
 *
 * This template can be used to give reference-counting powers
 * to a class. This template does not require this class to
 * have a virtual destructor or a specific (or any) parent class.
 * 
 * \note If you are moving to this template from the RefCountBase class,
 * you need to be careful to mark appropriately your destructor virtual
 * if needed. i.e., if your class has subclasses, _do_ mark your destructor
 * virtual.
 *
 *
 * This template takes 3 arguments but only the first argument is
 * mandatory:
 *
 * \tparam T \explicit The typename of the subclass which derives
 *      from this template class. Yes, this is weird but it's a
 *      common C++ template pattern whose name is CRTP (Curiously
 *      Recursive Template Pattern)
 * \tparam PARENT \explicit The typename of the parent of this template.
 *      By default, this typename is "'ns3::empty'" which is an empty
 *      class: compilers which implement the RBCO optimization (empty
 *      base class optimization) will make this a no-op
 * \tparam DELETER \explicit The typename of a class which implements
 *      a public static method named 'Delete'. This method will be called
 *      whenever the SimpleRefCount template detects that no references
 *      to the object it manages exist anymore.
 *
 * Interesting users of this class include ns3::Object as well as ns3::Packet.
