 * Example program illustrating use of ns3::RandomVariableStream
 *
 * This program can be run from waf such as
 * `./waf --run sample-random-variable-stream`
 * 
 * This program is about as simple as possible to display the use of ns-3 
 * to generate random numbers.  By default, the uniform random variate that
 * will be printed is 0.816532.  Because ns-3 uses a fixed seed for the
 * pseudo-random number generator, this program should always output the
 * same number.  Likewise, ns-3 simulations using random variables will
 * behave deterministically unless the user changes the Run number or the
 * Seed.
 * 
 * There are three primary mechanisms to change the seed or run numbers
 * from their default integer value of 1:
 * 
 * 1. Through explicit call of SeedManager::SetSeed () and 
 *    SeedManager::SetRun () (commented out below) 
 * 2. Through the passing of command line arguments such as:
 *    `./waf --command-template="%s --RngRun=<value>" --run program-name`
 * 3. Through the use of the NS_GLOBAL_VALUE environment variable, such as:
 *    `$ NS_GLOBAL_VALUE="RngRun=<value>" ./waf --run program-name`
 * 
 * For instance, setting the run number to 3 will change the program output to
 * 0.775417
 * 
 * Consult the ns-3 manual for more information about the use of the 
 * random number generator
