Topology Input Readers
----------------------

The topology modules aim at reading a topology file generated by an automatic topology generator.
 
The process is divided in two steps:

- running a topology generator to build a topology file
- reading the topology file and build a ns-3 simulation
 
Hence, model is focused on being able to read correctly the various topology formats.
 
Currently there are three models:

* ``ns3::OrbisTopologyReader`` for Orbis_ 0.7 traces 
* ``ns3::InetTopologyReader`` for Inet_ 3.0 traces 
* ``ns3::RocketfuelTopologyReader`` for Rocketfuel_ traces 
 
An helper ``ns3::TopologyReaderHelper`` is provided to assist on trivial tasks.
 
A good source for topology data is also Archipelago_.

The current Archipelago Measurements_, monthly updated, are stored in the CAIDA website using 
a complete notation and triple data source, one for each working group. 

A different and more compact notation reporting only the AS-relationships (a sort of more 
Orbis-like format) is here: as-relationships_.

The compact notation can be easily stripped down to a pure Orbis format, just removing
the double relationships (the compact format use one-way links, while Orbis use two-way
links) and pruning the 3rd parameter. Note that with the compact data Orbis can then be
used create a rescaled version of the topology, thus being the most effective way
(to my best knowledge) to make an internet-like topology.

Examples can be found in the directory ``src/topology-read/examples/``
