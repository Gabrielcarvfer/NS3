/**
 * \brief Handover algorithm implementation based on RSRQ measurements, Event
 *        A2 and Event A4.
 *
 * Handover decision made by this algorithm is primarily based on Event A2
 * measurements (serving cell's RSRQ becomes worse than threshold). When the
 * event is triggered, the first condition of handover is fulfilled.
 *
 * Event A4 measurements (neighbour cell's RSRQ becomes better than threshold)
 * are used to detect neighbouring cells and their respective RSRQ. When a
 * neighbouring cell's RSRQ is higher than the serving cell's RSRQ by a certain
 * offset, then the second condition of handover is fulfilled.
 *
 * When the first and second conditions above are fulfilled, the algorithm
 * informs the eNodeB RRC to trigger a handover.
 *
 * The threshold for Event A2 can be configured in the `ServingCellThreshold`
 * attribute. The offset used in the second condition can also be configured by
 * setting the `NeighbourCellOffset` attribute.
 *
 * The following code snippet is an example of using and configuring the
 * handover algorithm in a simulation program:
 *
 *     Ptr<LteHelper> lteHelper = CreateObject<LteHelper> ();
 *
 *     NodeContainer enbNodes;
 *     // configure the nodes here...
 *
 *     lteHelper->SetHandoverAlgorithmType ("ns3::A2A4RsrqHandoverAlgorithm");
 *     lteHelper->SetHandoverAlgorithmAttribute ("ServingCellThreshold",
 *                                               UintegerValue (30));
 *     lteHelper->SetHandoverAlgorithmAttribute ("NeighbourCellOffset",
 *                                               UintegerValue (1));
 *     NetDeviceContainer enbLteDevs = lteHelper->InstallEnbDevice (enbNodes);
 *
 * \note Setting the handover algorithm type and attributes after the call to
 *       LteHelper::InstallEnbDevice does not have any effect to the devices
 *       that have already been installed.
