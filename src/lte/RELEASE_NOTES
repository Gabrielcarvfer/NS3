Milestone 1 (M1) release of the LENA project (June 17, 2011)
============================================================

Here is a summary of the new features available in the LTE module with
this release:  


 - uplink PHY and MAC properly implemented including Adaptive
   Modulation and Coding (previously only downlink was supported)  

 - interference modeling was implemented: it is now possible to
   simulate multi-cell scenarios with inter-cell interference

 - flexible spectrum model: it is now possible to specify the carrier
   frequency and bandwidth of each cell independently 

 - an implementation of the Proportional Fair scheduler based on the
   FF LTE MAC Scheduler API is now included 

 - support for output of RLC and MAC layer Key Performance Indicators
   (KPIs) via dedicated trace sinks connected to newly defined trace
   sources 

 - the setting of the most relevant parameters (e.g. tx power, noise,
   carrier frequency, bandwidth, type of scheduler, etc.) is now done
   via the ns-3 attribute system   

 - several test suites have been added, including both unit tests that
   check the correct functionality of specific objects, and system
   tests that validate the output produced by the simulator in several
   scenarios of interest.

 - the documentation of the lte module has been entirely rewritten, it
   now features three separate sections: the design documentation, the
   user documentation and the testing documentation. 



First Public release of the LENA project (March 10, 2011)
=========================================================

The LENA code is based on the GSoC 2010 project code by Giuseppe Piro,
which was merged into ns-3-dev on December 2010. With respect to the GSoC
code, the main modifications that have been performed are: 

 - the MAC has been entirely rewritten to support the MAC Scheduler
   API defined by the Femto Forum, which is publicly available at this
   location: http://www.femtoforum.org/femto/technical.php

 - a Round Robin scheduler implementation based on the above API is
   also provided

 - the RLC API has been redefined  RLC in particular, at this stage
   only the API definition is in place, together with a simplified RLC
   implementation (RLC TM/UM/AM not available yet) 

  - the RRC has been entirely rewritten; we plan to reuse part of the
    GSoC 2010 flow classification code (which we plan to reuse) at a
    future stage for the implementation of Traffic Flow Template
    classifiers. 

  - network layer functionality has been temporarily disabled; it will
    be re-enabled when either RLC/UM or RLC/AM is available. 




GSoC 2010 release (merged into ns-3-dev on December 2010)
=========================================================

Here are 
In summary, the most important features provided by the
proposed module are (i) a basic implementation of both the
User Equipment (UE) and the enhanced NodeB (eNB) de-
vices, (ii) RRC entities for both the UE and the eNB, (iii)
a state-of-the-art Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC)
scheme for the downlink [9], (iv) the management of the
data radio bearers (with their QoS parameters), the MAC
queues and the RLC instances, (v) Channel Quality Indi-
cator (CQI) management, (vi) support for both uplink and
downlik packet scheduling, (vii) a PHY layer model with
Resource Block level granularity and (viii) a channel model
with the outdoor E-UTRAN propagation loss model.
