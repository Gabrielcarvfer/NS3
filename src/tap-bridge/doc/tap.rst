Tap NetDevice
-------------

The Tap NetDevice can be used to allow a host system or virtual machines to
interact with a simulation.

TapBridge Model Overview
************************

The Tap Bridge is designed to integrate "real" internet hosts (or more 
precisely, hosts that support Tun/Tap devices) into ns-3 simulations.  The 
goal is to make it appear to a "real" host node in that it has an ns-3 net
device as a local device.  The concept of a "real host" is a bit slippery
since the "real host" may actually be virtualized using readily available
technologies such as VMware, VirtualBox or OpenVZ.

Since we are, in essence, connecting the inputs and outputs of an ns-3 net 
device to the inputs and outputs of a Linux Tap net device, we call this 
arrangement a Tap Bridge.

There are three basic operating modes of this device available to users.  
Basic functionality is essentially identical, but the modes are different
in details regarding how the arrangement is created and configured;
and what devices can live on which side of the bridge.

We call these three modes the ConfigureLocal, UseLocal and UseBridge modes.
The first "word" in the camel case mode identifier indicates who has the 
responsibility for creating and configuring the taps.  For example,
the "Configure" in ConfigureLocal mode indicates that it is the TapBridge 
that has responsibility for configuring the tap.  In UseLocal mode and 
UseBridge modes, the "Use" prefix indicates that the TapBridge is asked to 
"Use" an existing configuration.

In other words, in ConfigureLocal mode, the TapBridge has the responsibility
for creating and configuring the TAP devices.  In UseBridge or UseLocal 
modes, the user provides a configuration and the TapBridge adapts to that 
configuration.

TapBridge ConfigureLocal Mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the ConfigureLocal mode, the configuration of the tap device is ns-3 
configuration-centric.  Configuration information is taken from a device
in the ns-3 simulation and a tap device matching the ns-3 attributes is 
automatically created.  In this case, a Linux computer is made to appear as
if it was directly connected to a simulated ns-3 network.

This is illustrated below: ::


    +--------+
    |  Linux |
    |  host  |                    +----------+
    | ------ |                    |   ghost  |
    |  apps  |                    |   node   |
    | ------ |                    | -------- |
    |  stack |                    |    IP    |     +----------+
    | ------ |                    |   stack  |     |   node   |
    |  TAP   |                    |==========|     | -------- |
    | device | <----- IPC ------> |   tap    |     |    IP    |
    +--------+                    |  bridge  |     |   stack  |
                                  | -------- |     | -------- |
                                  |   ns-3   |     |   ns-3   |
                                  |   net    |     |   net    |
                                  |  device  |     |  device  |
                                  +----------+     +----------+
                                       ||               ||
                                  +---------------------------+
                                  |        ns-3 channel       |
                                  +---------------------------+


In this case, the "ns-3 net device" in the "ghost node" appears as if it 
were actually replacing the TAP device in the Linux host.  The ns-3
simulation creates the TAP device on the underlying Linux OS and configures
the IP and MAC addresses of the TAP device to match the values assigned to 
the simulated ns-3 net device.  The "IPC" link shown above is the network
tap mechanism in the underlying OS.  The whole arrangement acts as a
conventional bridge; but a bridge between devices that happen to have the
same shared MAC and IP addresses.

Here, the user is not required to provide any configuration information 
specific to the tap.  A tap device will be created and configured by ns-3 
according to its defaults, and the tap device will have its name assigned
by the underlying operating system according to its defaults.

If the user has a requirement to access the created tap device, he or she
may optionally provide a "DeviceName" attribute.  In this case, the created 
OS tap device will be named accordingly.

The ConfigureLocal mode is the default operating mode of the Tap Bridge.

TapBridge UseLocal Mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The UseLocal mode is quite similar to the ConfigureLocal mode.  The
significant difference is, as the mode name implies, the TapBridge is 
going to "Use" an existing tap device previously created and configured
by the user.  This mode is particularly useful when a virtualization 
scheme automatically creates tap devices and ns-3 is used to provide 
simulated networks for those devices.

    +--------+
    |  Linux |
    |  host  |                    +----------+
    | ------ |                    |   ghost  |
    |  apps  |                    |   node   |
    | ------ |                    | -------- |
    |  stack |                    |    IP    |     +----------+
    | ------ |                    |   stack  |     |   node   |
    |  TAP   |                    |==========|     | -------- |
    | device | <----- IPC ------> |   tap    |     |    IP    |
    | MAC X  |                    |  bridge  |     |   stack  |
    +--------+                    | -------- |     | -------- | 
                                  |   ns-3   |     |   ns-3   |
                                  |   net    |     |   net    |
                                  |  device  |     |  device  |
                                  |  MAC Y   |     |  MAC Z   |
                                  +----------+     +----------+
                                       ||               ||
                                  +---------------------------+
                                  |        ns-3 channel       |
                                  +---------------------------+

In this case, the pre-configured MAC address of the "Tap device" (MAC X)
will not be the same as that of the bridged "ns-3 net device" (MAC Y) shown
in the illustration above.  In order to bridge to ns-3 net devices which do
not support SendFrom() (especially wireless STA nodes) we impose a requirement
that only one Linux device (with one unique MAC address -- here X) generates 
traffic that flows across the IPC link.  This is because the MAC addresses of
traffic across the IPC link will be "spoofed" or changed to make it appear to
Linux and ns-3 that they have the same address.  That is, traffic moving from
the Linux host to the ns-3 ghost node will have its MAC address changed from 
X to Y and traffic from the ghost node to the Linux host will have its MAC 
address changed from Y to X.  Since there is a one-to-one correspondence 
between devices, there may only be one MAC source flowing from the Linux side.
This means that Linux bridges with more than one net device added are 
incompatible with UseLocal mode.

In UseLocal mode, the user is expected to create and configure a tap device
completely outside the scope of the ns-3 simulation using something like:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ sudo tunctl -t tap0
  $ sudo ifconfig tap0 hw ether 08:00:2e:00:00:01
  $ sudo ifconfig tap0 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

To tell the TapBridge what is going on, the user will set either directly
into the TapBridge or via the TapBridgeHelper, the "DeviceName" attribute.
In the case of the configuration above, the "DeviceName" attribute would be 
set to "tap0" and the "Mode" attribute would be set to "UseLocal".

One particular use case for this mode is in the OpenVZ environment.  There it
is possible to create a Tap device on the "Hardware Node" and move it into a
Virtual Private Server.  If the TapBridge is able to use an existing tap device
it is then possible to avoid the overhead of an OS bridge in that environment.

TapBridge UseBridge Mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The simplest mode for those familiar with Linux networking is the UseBridge 
mode.  Again, the "Use" prefix indicates that the TapBridge is going to Use 
an existing configuration.  In this case, the TapBridge is going to logically
extend a Linux bridge into ns-3.  

This is illustrated below:

::

    +---------+
    |  Linux  |                             +----------+
    | ------- |                             |   ghost  |
    |  apps   |                             |   node   |
    | ------- |                             | -------- |
    |  stack  |                             |    IP    |     +----------+
    | ------- | +--------+                  |   stack  |     |   node   |
    | Virtual | |  TAP   |                  |==========|     | -------- |
    | Device  | | Device | <---- IPC -----> |   tap    |     |    IP    |
    +---------+ +--------+                  |  bridge  |     |   stack  |
        ||          ||                      | -------- |     | -------- |
    +--------------------+                  |   ns-3   |     |   ns-3   |
    | OS (brctl) Bridge  |                  |   net    |     |   net    |
    +--------------------+                  |  device  |     |  device  |
                                            +----------+     +----------+
                                                 ||               ||
                                            +---------------------------+
                                            |        ns-3 channel       |
                                            +---------------------------+

In this case, a computer running Linux applications, protocols, etc., is
connected to a ns-3 simulated network in such a way as to make it appear
to the Linux host that the TAP device is a real network device participating
in the Linux bridge.

In the ns-3 simulation, a TapBridge is created to match each TAP Device.
The name of the TAP Device is assigned to the Tap Bridge using the 
"DeviceName" attribute.  The TapBridge then logically extends the OS bridge
to encompass the ns-3 net device.  

Since this mode logically extends an OS bridge, there may be many Linux net 
devices on the non-ns-3 side of the bridge.  Therefore, like a net device on 
any bridge, the ns-3 net device must deal with the possibly of many source 
addresses.  Thus, ns-3 devices must support SendFrom() 
(NetDevice::SupportsSendFrom() must return true) in order to be configured 
for use in UseBridge mode.

It is expected that the user will do something like the following to
configure the bridge and tap completely outside ns-3:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ sudo brctl addbr mybridge
  $ sudo tunctl -t mytap
  $ sudo ifconfig mytap hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:01
  $ sudo ifconfig mytap 0.0.0.0 up
  $ sudo brctl addif mybridge mytap
  $ sudo brctl addif mybridge ...
  $ sudo ifconfig mybridge 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

To tell the TapBridge what is going on, the user will set either directly
into the TapBridge or via the TapBridgeHelper, the "DeviceName" attribute.
In the case of the configuration above, the "DeviceName" attribute would be 
set to "mytap" and the "Mode" attribute would be set to "UseBridge".

This mode is especially  useful in the case of virtualization where the 
configuration of the virtual hosts may be dictated by another system and 
not be changable to suit ns-3.  For example, a particular VM scheme may create
virtual "vethx" or "vmnetx" devices that appear local to virtual hosts.  In 
order to connect to such systems, one would need to manually create TAP devices
on the host system and brigde these TAP devices to the existing (VM) virtual 
devices.  The job of the Tap Bridge in this case is to extend the bridge to
join a ns-3 net device.

TapBridge ConfigureLocal Operation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In ConfigureLocal mode, the TapBridge and therefore its associated ns-3 net
device appears to the Linux host computer as a network device just like any
arbitrary "eth0" or "ath0" might appear.  The creation and configuration 
of the TAP device is done by the ns-3 simulation and no manual configuration
is required by the user.  The IP addresses, MAC addresses, gateways, etc., 
for created TAP devices are extracted from the simulation itself by querying
the configuration of the ns-3 device and the TapBridge Attributes.

Since the MAC addresses are identical on the Linux side and the ns-3 side,
we can use Send() on the ns-3 device which is available on all ns-3 net devices.
Since the MAC addresses are identical there is no requirement to hook the
promiscuous callback on the receive side.  Therefore there are no restrictions 
on the kinds of net device that are usable in ConfigureLocal mode.

The TapBridge appears to an ns-3 simulation as a channel-less net device.
This device must not have an IP address associated with it, but the bridged
(ns-3) net device must have an IP address.  Be aware that this is the inverse
of an ns-3 BridgeNetDevice (or a conventional bridge in general) which 
demands that its bridge ports not have IP addresses, but allows the bridge 
device itself to have an IP address.  

The host computer will appear in a simulation as a "ghost" node that contains
one TapBridge for each NetDevice that is being bridged.  From the perspective
of a simulation, the only difference between a ghost node and any other node 
will be the presence of the TapBridge devices.  Note however, that the 
presence of the TapBridge does affect the connectivity of the net device to 
the IP stack of the ghost node.

Configuration of address information and the ns-3 devices is not changed in 
any way if a TapBridge is present.  A TapBridge will pick up the addressing
information from the ns-3 net device to which it is connected (its "bridged"
net device) and use that information to create and configure the TAP device
on the real host.

The end result of this is a situation where one can, for example, use the
standard ping utility on a real host to ping a simulated ns-3 node.  If
correct routes are added to the internet host (this is expected to be done
automatically in future ns-3 releases), the routing systems in ns-3 will
enable correct routing of the packets across simulated ns-3 networks.
For an example of this, see the example program, tap-wifi-dumbbell.cc in 
the ns-3 distribution.

The Tap Bridge lives in a kind of a gray world somewhere between a Linux host
and an ns-3 bridge device.  From the Linux perspective, this code appears as
the user mode handler for a TAP net device.  In ConfigureLocal mode, this Tap 
device is automatically created by the ns-3 simulation.  When the Linux host 
writes to one of these automatically created /dev/tap devices, the write is 
redirected into the TapBridge that lives in the ns-3 world; and from this 
perspective, the packet write on Linux becomes a packet read in the Tap Bridge.
In other words, a Linux process writes a packet to a tap device and this packet
is redirected by the network tap mechanism toan ns-3 process where it is 
received by the TapBridge as a result of a read operation there.  The TapBridge
then writes the packet to the ns-3 net device to which it is bridged; and 
therefore it appears as if the Linux host sent a packet directly through an 
ns-3 net device onto an ns-3 network.

In the other direction, a packet received by the ns-3 net device connected to
the Tap Bridge is sent via a receive callback to the TapBridge.  The 
TapBridge then takes that packet and writes it back to the host using the 
network tap mechanism.  This write to the device will appear to the Linux 
host as if a packet has arrived on a net device; and therefore as if a packet
received by the ns-3 net device during a simulation has appeared on a real 
Linux net device.

The upshot is that the Tap Bridge appears to bridge a tap device on a
Linux host in the "real world" to an ns-3 net device in the simulation.
Because the TAP device and the bridged ns-3 net device have the same MAC
address and the network tap IPC link is not externalized, this particular
kind of bridge makes it appear that a ns-3 net device is actually installed
in the Linux host.

In order to implement this on the ns-3 side, we need a "ghost node" in the
simulation to hold the bridged ns-3 net device and the TapBridge.  This node
should not actually do anything else in the simulation since its job is 
simply to make the net device appear in Linux.  This is not just arbitrary 
policy, it is because:

- Bits sent to the TapBridge from higher layers in the ghost node (using
  the TapBridge Send method) are completely ignored.  The TapBridge is 
  not, itself, connected to any network, neither in Linux nor in ns-3.  You
  can never send nor receive data over a TapBridge from the ghost node.

- The bridged ns-3 net device has its receive callback disconnected
  from the ns-3 node and reconnected to the Tap Bridge.  All data received 
  by a bridged device will then be sent to the Linux host and will not be 
  received by the node.  From the perspective of the ghost node, you can 
  send over this device but you cannot ever receive.

Of course, if you understand all of the issues you can take control of
your own destiny and do whatever you want -- we do not actively
prevent you from using the ghost node for anything you decide.  You
will be able to perform typical ns-3 operations on the ghost node if
you so desire.  The internet stack, for example, must be there and
functional on that node in order to participate in IP address
assignment and global routing.  However, as mentioned above,
interfaces talking to any TapBridge or associated bridged net devices
will not work completely.  If you understand exactly what you are
doing, you can set up other interfaces and devices on the ghost node
and use them; or take advantage of the operational send side of the
bridged devices to create traffic generators.  We generally recommend
that you treat this node as a ghost of the Linux host and leave it to
itself, though.

TapBridge UseLocal Mode Operation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As described in above, the TapBridge acts like a bridge from the "real" world
into the simulated ns-3 world.  In the case of the ConfigureLocal mode, 
life is easy since the IP address of the Tap device matches the IP address of
the ns-3 device and the MAC address of the Tap device matches the MAC address
of the ns-3 device; and there is a one-to-one relationship between the 
devices.

Things are slightly complicated when a Tap device is externally configured 
with a  different MAC address than the ns-3 net device.  The conventional way
to deal with this kind of difference is to use promiscuous mode in the 
bridged device to receive packets destined for the different MAC address and 
forward them off to Linux.  In order to move packets the other way, the 
conventional solution is SendFrom() which allows a caller to "spoof" or change
the source MAC address to match the different Linux MAC address.

We do have a specific requirement to be able to bridge Linux Virtual Machines
onto wireless STA nodes.  Unfortunately, the 802.11 spec doesn't provide a 
good way to implement SendFrom(), so we have to work around that problem.

To this end, we provided the UseLocal mode of the Tap Bridge.  This mode allows 
you approach the problem as if you were creating a bridge with a single net
device.  A single allowed address on the Linux side is remembered in the 
TapBridge, and all packets coming from the Linux side are repeated out the 
ns-3 side using the ns-3 device MAC source address.  All packets coming in 
from the ns-3 side are repeated out the Linux side using the remembered MAC 
address.  This allows us to use Send() on the ns-3 device side which is 
available on all ns-3 net devices.

UseLocal mode is identical to the ConfigureLocal mode except for the creation
and configuration of the tap device and the MAC address spoofing.

TapBridge UseBridge Operation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As described in the ConfigureLocal mode section, when the Linux host writes to 
one of the /dev/tap devices, the write is redirected into the TapBridge
that lives in the ns-3 world.  In the case of the UseBridge mode, these
packets will need to be sent out on the ns-3 network as if they were sent on
a device participating in the Linux bridge.  This means calling the 
SendFrom() method on the bridged device and providing the source MAC address
found in the packet.

In the other direction, a packet received by an ns-3 net device is hooked
via callback to the TapBridge.  This must be done in promiscuous mode since
the goal is to bridge the ns-3 net device onto the OS (brctl) bridge of 
which the TAP device is a part.

For these reasons, only ns-3 net devices that support SendFrom() and have a
hookable promiscuous receive callback are allowed to participate in UseBridge
mode TapBridge configurations.

Tap Bridge Channel Model
************************

There is no channel model associated with the Tap Bridge.  In fact, the
intention is make it appear that the real internet host is connected to 
the channel of the bridged net device.

Tap Bridge Tracing Model
************************

Unlike most ns-3 devices, the TapBridge does not provide any standard trace
sources.  This is because the bridge is an intermediary that is essentially
one function call away from the bridged device.  We expect that the trace
hooks in the bridged device will be sufficient for most users,

Using the TapBridge
*******************

We expect that most users will interact with the TapBridge device through
the TapBridgeHelper.  Users of other helper classes, such as CSMA or Wifi,
should be comfortable with the idioms used there.
