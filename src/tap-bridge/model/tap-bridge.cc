  // The TapBridge has three distinct operating modes.  At this point, the
  // differences revolve around who is responsible for creating and configuring
  // the underlying network tap that we use.  In ConfigureLocal mode, the 
  // TapBridge has the responsibility for creating and configuring the TAP.
  //
  // In UseBridge or UseLocal modes, the user will provide us a configuration
  // and we have to adapt to it.  For example, in UseLocal mode, the user will
  // be configuring a tap device outside the scope of the ns-3 simulation and
  // will be expecting us to work with it.  The user will do something like:
  //
  //   sudo tunctl -t tap0
  //   sudo ifconfig tap0 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:01
  //   sudo ifconfig tap0 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
  //
  // The user will then set the "Mode" Attribute of the TapBridge to "UseLocal"
  // and the "DeviceName" Attribute to "tap0" in this case.
  //
  // In ConfigureLocal mode, the user is asking the TapBridge to do the 
  // configuration and create a TAP with the provided "DeviceName" with which 
  // the user can later do what she wants.  We need to extract values for the
  // MAC address, IP address, net mask, etc, from the simualtion itself and 
  // use them to initialize corresponding values on the created tap device.
  //
  // In UseBridge mode, the user is asking us to use an existing tap device
  // has been included in an OS bridge.  She is asking us to take the simulated
  // net device and logically add it to the existing bridge.  We expect that
  // the user has done something like:
  //
  //   sudo brctl addbr mybridge
  //   sudo tunctl -t mytap
  //   sudo ifconfig mytap hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:01
  //   sudo ifconfig mytap 0.0.0.0 up
  //   sudo brctl addif mybridge mytap
  //   sudo brctl addif mybridge ...
  //   sudo ifconfig mybridge 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
  //
  // The bottom line at this point is that we want to either create or use a 
  // tap device on the host based on the verb part "Use" or "Configure" of the 
  // operating mode.  Unfortunately for us you have to have root privileges to
  // do either.  Instead of running the entire simulation as root, we decided 
  // to make a small program who's whole reason for being is to run as suid 
  // root and do what it takes to create the tap.  We're just going to pass 
  // off the configuration information to that program and let it deal with
  // the situation.
